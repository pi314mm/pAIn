===============
This was inpired by reading an article on AI ethics where society places value on a living creature if it demonstrates that it feels pain.
This AI will live for approximately 10 minutes before dying unless it gets help by a user dragging their mouse over the affected area.

If a user tries to help a specific area too much, then they begin to hurt it instead so wait a while before helping it again.

Run the executable jar file to make your AI come alive.
